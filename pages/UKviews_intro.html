    <h2 class="center_font">Geography of UK</h2>

    <p>
      Before we proceed, let's introduce a little of UK's physical geaography. United Kingdom is
      actually an <span class="brown">Island Country</span>, which means that the major
      part of it's territory consists in a group of islands. Some smallers, some biggers, 
      an they are spread through England, Wales, Scottland and Northern Irelan. For this reason,
      beaches and lakes are super common in it's nature, and some of it's beaches pass some 
      time of the years underneath the ocean's water due to the tidal level.

      The image beside this text is a Topography of UK's territory. As you can see, there's
      many <span class="green">green</span> and <span class="red">yellow to red</span> parts.
      These colors on it's topography means 2 things: <span class="green">Low terrain</span>
      and <span class="red">Moutains</span>. That's right, a pretty big part of UK is based on
      low terrain and moutains! They give UK outstanding views and unique places that are
      totally worth traveling in!

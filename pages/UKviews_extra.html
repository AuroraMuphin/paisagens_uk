      United Kingdom is a big Archipelago that extends through the north and south parts
      of Europe. That means, it's climate is mostly temperate, but it get colder near the
      north parts, so you can see sub-tropical to subarctic regions. It's also good to 
      notice that the climate there have high levels of precipitation, which means that 
      the clouds are havier almost all the time so the rain aesthetic is pretty present in 
      the entire UK.
